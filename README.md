# Computer-from-Nand
An implementation of the Hack computer system, built entirely from first principles. The repository includes hardware components written in HDL, the assembler, virtual machine translator, and compiler — forming a complete computing stack capable of executing high-level programs on custom-built hardware.

The hardware simulator, assembler, and other support tools used in this project are provided by the official nand2tetris.org￼ course resources. All proprietary materials remain the property of their respective creators; this repository contains only original implementations and project files developed independently for learning and demonstration purposes.
